Over the last year, after my transition to being self-employed, I worked mostly from home. At first, I was worried whether I would be able to do that in a sustainable way.

There are several pitfalls when working from a home-office such as motivating yourself, handling distractions, taking breaks and drawing a line between work and leisure time.

TODO: enjoy working from home, less distractions, motivating works if things you work on are ok - useful as indicator

One of the big things I noticed quickly, was that I sat even more than in my previous job. As a software engineer, sitting a lot is part of the deal, but with regular meetings, coffee breaks, mentoring and cross-team discussions there is at least some standing and walking baked right into the daily routine.

Working from home, most of these "natural" opportunities to stand up and walk went away and I noticed in a painful way, that I was sitting way too much.

## My Current Process 

I think the most important part of my daily routine is the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The idea is pretty simple - you work on a task for a fixed amount of time (a pomodoro, e.g.: 25 minutes) without any distractions and take a short break after. Then, after a certain amount of pomodoros (e.g.: 4), you take a longer break.

In my case, I do 25-minute pomodoros with short breaks in-between and a longer break after 3 pomodoros. I use [Kanbanflow](https://kanbanflow.com) for tracking tasks and pomodoros.

During the pomodoros, all notifications are off and I try to ignore all distractions. Of course this doesn't work as well for every circumstance - it works perfectly for purely technical tasks while working at home for example, but is a lot harder to execute with other people in an office or while executing a task which needs communication. 

I don't follow a very strict ruleset for which pomodoros I count, but I think when starting out with the technique it makes sense to follow it to the letter for a few weeks to see how it feels.

In my experience, one feels quite busy and productive when Multi-tasking, but the measured reality looks very different. Try focused, distraction-free work for a day and you'll feel the difference. Also, there is plenty of time in-between pomodoros to handle requests from colleagues etc. - just try to get everything off your plate for the next productive pomodoro session.

Splitting work up into pomodoros makes big problems seem manageable and has the nice side-effect of being measurable in terms of daily progress over time.

TODO: pitfall -> don't overdo it, measuring pomodoros is nice and all, but pushing it has negative effects

## Benefits 

There are, I think, several benefits to using this technique with the most important one being the focus on one thing for a certain amount of time without any distractions. Between colleagues, Chat tools (Slack...) and a phone it's very hard to get some focused work done.

Another great benefit is, that with a fixed process you actually take breaks and don't skip them. Everyone knows the feeling of hammering your head against a hard problem - you're almost there, just a few minutes now...and then it's late at night and the problem is still not solved. You go home, sleep a few hours and the next morning you sit down and solve the problem within 5 minutes.

We all know how important rest is, so our subconcious can work out the hard problems and to refresh us mentally and physically, yet it's so hard for many people to actually take good breaks and to get enough sleep consistently. I believe a routine, which includes enough break time by default makes this a lot easier. Worst case you smash your head against that wall for 25 minutes - then the timer goes off and you actually stand up, walk away and have a chance to free your mind.

Splitting the day up into several parts also has some nice advantages. For example, switching between sitting on my normal chair, a sitting ball and working standing up works very naturally with pomodoros - this is also the reason why I split my day into pockets of 3 pomodoros and take a longer break after each of these pockets.

In these longer breaks I usually do some exercises as well. Of course this is a lot easier working from home without a dress-code and people looking at you in a weird way. In general, I like using my breaks, long and short for walking away from the computer and doing manual things (e.g.: washing the dishes, exercises, cooking...) to disentangle my mind. This has some nice time-saving benefits, but also helps productivity, as it prevents getting stuck for too long. 

After some time using pomodoro, when I had a lot to do and felt a bit stressed, I found that I trusted my focused "pockets of work" to get me there. This is very important I think, to trust in your process and to not stray from it and fall into bad habits when things get stressful.

TODO: flow, routines / habits in general probably have most of these benefits, does not need to be pomodoro

## Conclusion

A sustainable work-process is invaluable both for productivity and for personal health. I am satisfied with the progress I made so far, but will continue to try and improve or tune my process as necessary.

Most importantly though, I will focus on not falling back into bad habits such as overworking or missing breaks - it's just not efficient both in the short and in the long run.
