Over the last year, after my transition to being self-employed, I worked mostly from home. At first, I was worried whether I would be able to do that in a sustainable way.

There are several pitfalls when working from a home-office such as motivating yourself, handling distractions, taking breaks and drawing a line between work and leisure time.

One of the big things I noticed quickly, was that I sat even more than in my previous job. As a software engineer, sitting a lot is part of the deal, but with regular meetings, coffee breaks, mentoring and cross-team discussions there is at least some standing and walking baked right into the daily routine.

Working from home, most of these "natural" opportunities to stand up and walk went away and I noticed in a painful way, that I was sitting way too much.

Pomodoro

Benefits
    trust your "pockets of work" to get stuff done - reduces stress overall
        makes eating healthy / exercising easier
    exercises in-between
    improved process with sitting/sitting ball/height-adjustable desk
timeular zei - monitoring

be realistic - doesn't work for all kinds of work, good for straight up development/problem solving, needs to be adapted for communications-heavy things

most importantly: don't overdo it, overworking and missing breaks is the bane of all productivity, even in a short timespan. If you have a sustainable, optimized workflow, trust it to get work done more quickly than just "pushing through"

## Benefits 

TBD

## Conclusion

A sustainable work-process is invaluable both for productivity and for personal health. I am satisfied with the progress I made so far, but will continue to try and improve or tune my process as necessary.

Most importantly though, I will focus on not falling back into bad habits such as overworking or missing breaks - it's just not efficient both in the short and in the long run.
