Since it started in 2014, Craft Conf has been one of my absolute fix-points in regards to Software Conferences each year.

With a focus on Software Craftsmanship and a mindset for improvement, the conference has steadily grown and attracts some of the best speakers from all around the world. It is usually exceptionally well organized and cheap enough to be able to afford it on a private budget. 

The presented topics are usually broad, but reflect the current trends in the industry, which makes the conference accessible to software professionals from many different fields and with different experience levels.

This year was my fourth time attending Craft in the wonderful city of Budapest with some friends and it was a blast :)

The venue at the Railway Museum (MAGYAR VASÚTTÖRTÉNETI PARK) is a good mix between a practical location, which provides enough space for the vast amount of attendees and a beautiful space to chill out and look at some trains in the breaks.

Organizationally, Craft has always been on point regarding it's communication style and schedule and this year was no exception. Food in Budapest is usually a non-issue because hungarian cuisine and their mindset toward food is great and you can be sure to have something tasty to eat in vast quantities.

## Day1

The first day started off with a morning keynote by Amazon's Tim Wagner, which was a bit disappointing, as the talk was more a long version of an AWS Lambda advertising, than a mindset-improving keynote. I guess the financial realities of hosting an event of this scale require trade-offs like this, but it was still a bit of a bummer.

Fortunately, the great Damien Conway more than made up for the botched morning keynote by delivering a fun and inspiring experience with his evening keynote **Fun With Dead Languages** showing us, among other things, the power of [Executable Latin](http://search.cpan.org/~dconway/Lingua-Romana-Perligata-0.601/) ;)




## Day2



## Conclusion

Another year, another great Craft experience. Craft Conf is and has been THE one conference I schedule well ahead of time and which I consider an absolute must-attend.

It is also my go-to conference if someone asks me for great tech conferences, as it continues to deliver at a very high level.

Thank You to the Craft Conf team for the awesomeness that was 2017's Craft :)
