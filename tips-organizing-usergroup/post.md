I love attending tech conferences and user groups. I believe, that sharing knowledge with your community is one of the most rewarding experiences in the field of software engineering (and probably many other fields as well). 

## The Basics

I have visited many meetups and even organized one for some time over the last couple of years and in this post I want to share some of my opinions on what makes a user group a great experience for attendees as well as organizers. However, I won't go into the **basics** of how to start and run a meetup, as these topics have been covered in great length and detail already by others such as [this](https://raygun.com/blog/2014/11/run-successful-tech-meetup/) nice illustration, or Nathen Harvey's [post](http://nathenharvey.com/blog/2011/12/13/tips-for-hosting-a-tech-user-group/) from 2011, which is still relevant today. I also enjoyed reading [this](https://techspark.co/need-to-know-how-to-build-a-top-tech-meetup-group/) more recent post by Alice Whale on the topic. 

An attempt at a very superficial summary of things to consider could look like this:

* Consistent Date, Time & Location 
* Make **everyone** feel welcome 
* Enable **relaxed** networking
* Get sponsors
  * Raffle options
     * [Manning books](https://www.manning.com/)
     * [o'reilly books](http://www.oreilly.com/)
     * [Jetbrains Licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
     * Local Conferences for free tickets
     * Company behind the topic / product your User Group is about
  * Location / Food & Drinks Sponsoring
     * Local Companies with a recruiting incentive
     * Local Co-working spaces
* Get the word out & Keep people updated (Twitter, Meetup.com etc.)
* Get regular **feedback** & Try out new things


This post will instead focus on two topics I have reflected on quite heavily over the last months:

* **Time Limits for Talks**
* **Open Spaces**

So, without further ado, let's get into it!

## Time Limits for Talks 

The problem of **how long should a talk be** is, even among professional conferences, an unsolved one. There are different approaches depending on the crowd, the speakers, the venue, the topic...and many other variables. When deciding this for your User Group, you might consider different factors as well. 

### Things to consider

One very important thing to consider is attention-span. I prefer short **impulse**-talks in almost any circumstance, as they capture your attention-span well and inspire you to try something new or think differently about something. This is especially true for User Groups which are held during after-work hours (which most I have attended are). After a long day of work, the attention-span is even shorter and most people will likely not be able to get the full benefit of a 2 hour talk with live-coding that goes into excruciating detail on every aspect of the covered topic.

Another aspect to consider is, that the speakers are usually not **professional** speakers with a lot of experiences. So what happens often is that the talks go way over the time limit, which reduces important time for networking later and doesn't really benefit people.
A lot of times, User Group organizers are reluctant to interrupt or break off a talk which goes over the time limit, because these events are supposed to be relaxed and welcoming. Another reason I heard a few times was that it would be such a waste after the speaker has obviously invested so much time and effort in conjuring up all of this content.

The reality however, and I think everyone who has done any kind of professional public speaking (teaching, training, conference talks) will agree with me here, is that people who go way over time and have way too much content are **not overprepared**, but **underprepared**. The hardest parts when creating a good presentation is not gathering material, but cutting it down to the most valuable essence, putting as little as possible on slides and then practicing that talk so often, that you know at each sentence how much time you have left without needing a clock.

This is, in any case, how people usually prepare for **professional** speaking. But we want a **relaxed** atmosphere to give newcomers a way to share their stuff as well as to give people interested in speaking at conferences a training ground, so rigidly filtering out talks doesn't really help anyone. Besides, User Groups in smaller cities usually suffer from not having enough speakers as it is, so discouraging them with lofty quality standards probably won't be very helpful. 

So what to do?

### The Solution

I believe a practical solution to this dilemma is to have an **openly communicated rigorous time limit**.

So instead of just stating that "talks should be about ~25 minutes", you clearly state


## Open Space 


### What is an Open Space?


### What are the benefits?


### How to do an Open Space?


## Conclusion

Community is an important part of a software developer's journey in my opinion. Sharing your experiences and knowledge is rewarding and can open doors you wouldn't have thought were there. However, the manner in which this is done is important both for oneself and the community, which is why regular feedback and self reflection are of critical importance when organizing or co-organizing a User Group.

This post covered two ways which in my opinion have the power to improve the experience of people involved in tech Meetups, but there are certainly many other ways to achieve just that and it's definitely worth experimenting with new ideas and looking around for further inspiration. :).
